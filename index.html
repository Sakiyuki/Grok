      <p>At GROK, everyone is welcome, and we invite some of the best designers and thinkiers in the industry to mediate the 10.20's and their experience and insight to every converation</p>
       <p>What are the Infamous 10/20s?</p>
         <p>The 10/20s are mediated discussions between about a dozen participants.  Anyone in a 10/20 can propose a topic for discussion. You can talk about software, your work environment, your personal challenges- anything that's on your mind.</p>
           <p>After 10 minutes of conversation, the session leader can chose to close the topic and ask for another.  If the conversation is particularly interesting, the session leader can extend the clock for another 10 minutes, hence the name, "10/20."</p>

     <h3>Keynote Speakers</h3>
      <p>In the past, we've enlisted mediators like Joshua Blankenship, Matt Donovan, Paul Armstrong, Marco Suarez, Jackson Alexander, Ryan McCrary, James White, Johnny LeHane, Pamela Pavliscak, Richard Banfield, & Carl Smith to bring their experience and insight to every conversation.  this year, GROK 2015 brings to you some of the best and brightest in our industry.</p>

       <h3>Moldover</h3>
          <p>If technology and music are your life, brace yourself- MOLDOVER is about to reformat your soul. Hailed by over 1,000,000 YouTube viewers as "The Godfather of Controllerism", Moldover is a new breed of music icon. Combining the charisma of a rock star, the mad genius of a basement inventor, and the radical inclusiveness of the DIY internet generation, Moldover is "literally throwing away the rule book and reinventing the wheel" (Remix Magazine). Witness his balls-to-the-wall LIVE SHOW at a club, experience one of his JAMBOX multiplayer instruments at a festival, or pick up and play the "LIGHT THEREMIN" packaging of his debut album and understand why the next paradigm for music is a one-man-brand called Moldover.</p>
